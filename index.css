       No, the logo provided "Lyta" is dark. 
       The screenshot shows "FA" in white. 
       If the logo is dark and background is blue, multiply makes it darker. 
       Wait. "Lyta" logo is dark slate text on white bg (Image 3). 
       Blue bg + Multiply = Dark Text on Blue. 
       Screenshot 1 shows WHITE text "FA" on Blue.
       
       If I use multiply, the white part of logo becomes transparent (good), but the dark text "Lyta" remains dark (bad vs screenshot feeling?).
       Measurements: User said "appearance almost exactly mimic photo". 
       The photo has white logo. 
       The provided logo is dark. 
       I should probably invert the logo or make it white if possible with css filters, OR just use it as is if "logo position" is what matters.
       User says "use image 3 as logo... file name will change later... temporary setting".
       I'll stick to multiply for now to handle the box, but maybe brightness(0) invert(1) to make it white?
       Let's try to make it white to match the aesthetic of "FA" in visual.
